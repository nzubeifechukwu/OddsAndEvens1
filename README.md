 * This program is a game called "Odds and Evens". It is played between two players, in this case user versus the computer.
 * Each player will choose either "odds" or "evens", since user is playing the computer user will get first pick.
 * Once the players have chosen sides, they each choose a number of fingers to play -- 1 to 10.
 * The winner is determined by whether the sum of both players' fingers is odd or even (depending on what they chose).
